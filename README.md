# Bivariate Normal Distribution Analysis

This project, focusing on Mathematics, was developed as part of my 3rd-year Computer Science curriculum at ENSISA.

## Project Goals

The focus of this project is the analysis of the **bivariate normal distribution**, specifically studying the **contours of constant density** and calculating the probability of points falling within these contours. Through mathematical derivations and numerical simulations in Python, the project aims to demonstrate that the density contours of a bivariate normal distribution are ellipses, and explores their properties.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:
- **Sujet.pdf**: The project description, including mathematical and programming tasks.
- **Rapport.pdf**: The project report, detailing mathematical derivations and explanations of the program.
- **program.py**: The Python script that implements the numerical simulations and computations.

Please note that *Sujet.pdf* and *Rapport.pdf* are written in French.
